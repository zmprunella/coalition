# Project Reflection

## Overview

This project was an engaging and rewarding experience. It offered opportunities to apply my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a practical manner, which was both challenging and fun.

## The Fun Part

Working on this project was incredibly enjoyable for several reasons:

- **Problem-Solving**: Finding solutions to make the carousel work, or getting the right CSS properties to make the website look just as envisioned, was gratifying.
- **Learning**: This project provided me a great platform to learn new things, especially about how to make a website more interactive and user-friendly.

- **Coding**: Writing and seeing the code turn into a functional, good-looking website is always satisfying.

## Confusion about Accordion Feature

One aspect that was a bit confusing during the project was the implementation of the accordion feature. The instructions were not entirely clear about which sections required the accordion functionality.

- **Mountain Tabs**: I was unsure if the "Mountain 1" and "Mountain 2" tabs were supposed to use the accordion effect.
- **History and Team Links**: I was equally unsure about whether the "History" and "Team" navigation links were supposed to be implemented as accordions.

## Moving Forward

While I have paused the accordion feature based on my best understanding of the instructions, I am more than willing to make adjustments as soon as this is clarified.

Thank you for this fantastic project, and I look forward to further instructions to make any necessary revisions.
